Explanation:

The HTML creates a form with a username input field and a submit button.
The JavaScript:
Gets references to the input field, form, and profile information container elements.
Adds an event listener to the form for submission.
Prevents default form submission behavior and retrieves the entered username.
Validates if the username is empty.
Uses the fetch API to call the GitHub user API with the username.
Parses the JSON response and displays relevant user information like login name, name (if available), bio (if available), and a link to their GitHub profile.
Handles errors by displaying an error message in case the API request fails.
Additional Notes:

You can customize the displayed information and styling based on your preference.
Consider adding a loading indicator while fetching data.
Explore GitHub API documentation for more details on available user information: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28
Remember to replace /_ Add some basic styling here (optional) _/ with your desired styling for the webpage.
